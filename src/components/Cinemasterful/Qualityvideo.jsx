        <p>iPhone 16 Pro takes video capture to a whole new level with <span>4K 120 fps Dolby Vision</span> â€” our highest resolution and frame rate combo yet.

        <p>And now you can <span>adjust the playback speed after capture</span> in the redesigned Photos app, giving you greater editing capabilities. To add a dreamy quality to your shot, try out the new half-speed option. Or for a cinematic effect, slow it right down to 24 fps playback.</p>

        <p>iPhone 16 Pro also provides a big leap in audio performance with four studio-quality mics for higher-quality recording. They provide a lower noise floor so you get more true-to-life sounds. New Spatial Audio capture makes your videos sound more immersive when listening with AirPods. And thanks to wind noise reduction, the audio quality is even clearer.</p>
